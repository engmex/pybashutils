bash-utils
==========

```cupd```: update conda packages (well, the ones I use)

```checkIP```: Sends you an email automatically if your IP address changes

```getIP```: gets your public IP address (not the internal NAT address)

```findtext```: find text inside files matching pattern.

mx: mount network share example using SSHFS

Collection of Bash scripts I've made that may be generally useful

Some of them are quite old and do NOT reflect my current level of Bash knowledge.

I used these to teach myself Bash so there might be some silliness within.
